# XcapeRoom

Final project for the Advanced User Interfaces course at Politecnico di Milano.
It is a mixed reality videogame for the Crypt of San Sepolcro in Milan.

The aim was to propose a playful and technological alternative to the traditional visit of the crypt through the creation of a cultural Escape Room.
